When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with other people on same project or travel across the country.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you choose when and what to pull from the repo. If it`s automatically there is pretty big chance to pull things that are from other users and/or not finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are cloned repos but just at github site only. Clone do the same but locally and branches made different head of the structure of commits. 

Forks would be used when You want to clone someone repo @ github site and then clone it locally to your PC and then if You don`t want to mess with the original files that You clone make other branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The benefit is that you can work and make changes locally without internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I suppose using multiple mails or a IM software with a option for file transfer. Using Git is far more efficient and easier to use instead mail or IM soft. Almost everything will be easier and got done more quickly and efficient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I made several minor changes and want to be available other to see and check it that these changes are ok with him. Work with separate branches gives you flexibility and several options to operates. With working directly in master is more easy and plain to use but don't give You the amount of options of branches and the chance to co-op.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with other people on same project or travel across the country.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you choose when and what to pull from the repo. If it`s automatically there is pretty big chance to pull things that are from other users and/or not finished.

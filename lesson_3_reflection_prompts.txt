When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I work with other people on same project or travel across the country.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you choose when and what to pull from the repo. If it`s automatically there is pretty big chance to pull things that are from other users and/or not finished.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are cloned repos but just at github site only. Clone do the same but locally and branches made different head of the structure of commits. 
Forks would be used when You want to clone someone repo @ github site and then clone it locally to your PC and then if You don`t want to mess with the original files that You clone make other branch.
